_**Guess the Pattern**_ is a game where the player is shown a sequence on a grid of squares, then they have to click the squares in that sequence to **level up.**

As the player progresses through the game, the sequence they have to repeat becomes longer and longer, until they press the wrong button and it's **Game Over**. After that, the player has to start again from **Level 1**

The game can be played on different grid sizes, _2 x 2_, _3 x 3_, and _4 x 4_. Each player can choose the grid they prefer, as a larger grid doesn't necessarily mean a higher difficulty.

There's also a score system, each level advanced representing another point on the scoreboard. The highscore you achieve is registered for that particular stage (grid)

<h1> Gamemodes </h1>
There are currently 3 gamemodes available: Classic and Timed:

 - In CLASSIC, you play the base game, described earlier.

- In TIMED, the classic game experience is enhanced by the introduction of a _timer_, which ticks down the moment you input the first pattern. After that, the player has to pass as many levels as they can in the designated time. The timer only ticks down when the player has to repeat the sequence.

- In REFLEX, the gameplay changes completely, instead of memorizing a pattern, you have to click the highlighted square as fast as possible. Your quickest reaction time represents your highscore. Clicking the wrong square results in a Game Over.

<h1> Items and Shop </h1>
By playing the different gamemodes you are awarded coins that can be spent in the shop to buy items that will help you beat your highscore

<h2>Revealer</h2>
Shows you the pattern again, from the point where you left it off at. It is very useful in the later level if you forget the rest of the sequence, as they can get pretty long.

<h2>Revive</h2>
It grants you another chance at continuing after you missclick a square and hit Game Over. Also, it reveals the rest of the sequence from where you lost, esentially giving you a free Revealer as well, but for more coins. (Prices are still being balanced)

<h1> Personalization </h1>
Throught the screenshots you may have noticed different backgrounds and colors for the squares, the Settings menu allows you to personalize these, as well as having the squares numbered or not and adjusting the volume of the music and the sound effects in the game. There are predefined colors and background that can be purchased with coins, but the premium version of the game allows you to customize them entirely. You can either use the slides or input a hex code for the color of the squares and browse your files for a custom background image.

It is a fun game to test and improve your memory, while also trying to beat your own highscore!
