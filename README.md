_**Guess the Pattern**_ is a game where the player is shown a sequence on a grid of squares, then they have to click the squares in that sequence to **level up.**

As the player progresses through the game, the sequence they have to repeat becomes longer and longer, until they press the wrong button and it's **Game Over**. After that, the player has to start again from **Level 1**

The game can be played on different grid sizes, _2 x 2_, _3 x 3_, and _4 x 4_. Each player can choose the grid they prefer, as a larger grid doesn't necessarily mean a higher difficulty.

There's also a score system, each level advanced representing another point on the scoreboard. The highscore you achieve is registered for that particular stage (grid)
| Score increasing | On "_Game Over_", the highscore is overwritten |

<h1> Gamemodes </h1>
There are currently 2 gamemodes available: Classic and Timed:

 - In CLASSIC, you play the base game, described earlier.

- In TIMED, the classic game experience is enhanced by the introduction of a _timer_, which ticks down the moment you input the first pattern. After that, the player has to pass as many levels as they can in the designated time. The timer only ticks down when the player has to repeat the sequence. 

<h1> Personalization </h1>
The Settings menu allows you to personalize things such as the color of the squares in the stage, have numbers on them or not, but also adjust the volume of the music and the sound effects in the game.

More in the future: Custom Backgrounds, More colors

| Chosen color is yellow, numbered squares is checked | How the stage looks |

It is a fun game to test and improve your memory, while also trying to beat your own highscore!
