_**Guess The Pattern**_ is a game where the player is shown a sequence on a grid of squares, then they have to click the squares in that sequence to **level up.**

As the player progresses through the game, the sequence they have to repeat becomes longer and longer, until they press the wrong button and it's **Game Over**, after that the player has to start again from **Level 1**

The game can be played on different difficulties, _Easy_, _Medium_, and _Hard_. Each difficulty representing a larger grid of squares.
**Easy**

There's also a score system, each level advanced representing another point on the scoreboard.
It is a fun game to test and improve your memory, while also trying to beat your own highscore!
