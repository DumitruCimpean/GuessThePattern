_**Guess the Pattern**_ is a game where the player is shown a sequence on a grid of squares, then they have to click the squares in that sequence to **level up.**

As the player progresses through the game, the sequence they have to repeat becomes longer and longer, until they press the wrong button and it's **Game Over**. After that, the player has to start again from **Level 1**

The game can be played on different difficulties, _Easy_, _Medium_, and _Hard_. Each difficulty representing a larger grid of squares.

| Easy | Medium | Hard |

There's also a score system, each level advanced representing another point on the scoreboard.\
It is a fun game to test and improve your memory, while also trying to beat your own highscore!
